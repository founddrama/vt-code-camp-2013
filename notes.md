# Beyond "ng-hello-world" : Building Real World Web Apps with AngularJS

**Abstract:**

> AngularJS is an open-source front-end MVC framework from Google for dynamic
> web apps. On top of the customary MVC features, AngularJS has a rich
> vocabulary of components including services for code sharing, filters for view
> layer data transformation, and directives for extending HTML. At Dealer.com,
> we recently built a centralized remote configuration service and we chose
> AngularJS to handle the user interface concerns. This talk will provide a
> high-level introduction to AngularJS, discuss the front-end challenges we
> faced, and describe how we solved those problems with AngularJS.
